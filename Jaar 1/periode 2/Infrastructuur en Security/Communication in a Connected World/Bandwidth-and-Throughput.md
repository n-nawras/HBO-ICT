# Bandwidth and Throughput

## 1.3.1 Bandwidth
- **Bandwidth**: The capacity of a medium to transmit data over time, measured in bits per second (bps).
  - Common units: 
    - **Kbps**: Thousands of bits per second.
    - **Mbps**: Millions of bits per second.
    - **Gbps**: Billions of bits per second.
- Factors affecting bandwidth:
  - Physical media properties.
  - Current technologies.
  - Laws of physics.

## 1.3.2 Throughput
- **Throughput**: The actual rate of data transfer across the network, typically lower than maximum bandwidth.
- Influenced by:
  - The amount of data being transmitted.
  - The types of data being sent.
  - **Latency**: Delays caused by the number of devices or the distance between source and destination.
- Throughput is limited by the slowest link in the data path, regardless of other high-bandwidth segments.
- Online tools can measure internet connection throughput.
