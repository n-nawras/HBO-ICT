# Communications in a Connected World

## 1.4.1 What Did I Learn in this Module?

### Network Types
- The internet is a global collection of interconnected networks using common standards.  
- Networks range from:
  - Small home setups (SOHO).
  - Large corporate or school networks with thousands of devices.  
- Many devices connect to the internet:
  - Smartphones, smart TVs, gaming consoles.
  - Smart cars, RFID tags, and medical devices.  

### Data Transmission
- **Types of Personal Data**:
  - **Volunteered**: Shared directly by users (e.g., profiles, videos).  
  - **Observed**: Captured through user actions (e.g., location data).  
  - **Inferred**: Derived from other data (e.g., credit scores).  
- Data is transmitted as **bits** (0s and 1s) using:
  - Electrical signals (copper wires).
  - Optical signals (light pulses).
  - Wireless signals (infrared, microwave, or radio waves).  

### Bandwidth and Throughput
- **Bandwidth**: Theoretical data capacity of a medium (Kbps, Mbps, Gbps).  
- **Throughput**: Actual data transfer rate, affected by:
  - Data volume being sent and received.
  - **Latency**: Delays caused by distance or devices.

## 1.4.2 Reflection
The internet, a resilient network of networks, connects millions of devices. Understanding its structure helps improve and maintain it, even when parts encounter issues.
