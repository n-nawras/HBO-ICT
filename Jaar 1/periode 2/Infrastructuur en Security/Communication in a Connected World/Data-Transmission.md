# Data Transmission

## 1.2.1 Video - Types of Personal Data
Details omitted (covered in video).

## 1.2.2 The Bit
- Computers process and store data as **binary digits (bits)**: 0 or 1.
- A bit is the smallest unit of data and can represent two states (e.g., light on/off, voltage high/low).
- Input devices convert human actions into binary; output devices convert binary into human-readable formats.
- Data (letters, numbers, symbols) is encoded in binary using systems like **ASCII**:
  - Example: `A = 01000001`, `9 = 00111001`, `# = 00100011`.
- **8 bits = 1 byte**, used to represent various types of information (text, images, audio, etc.).

## 1.2.3 Common Methods of Data Transmission
- Data (bits) is converted into signals for transmission over a network:
  - **Electrical signals**: Pulses on copper wires.
  - **Optical signals**: Light pulses on fiber-optic cables.
  - **Wireless signals**: Infrared, microwave, or radio waves through the air.
- Signals may change formats across media (e.g., from electrical to optical).
- Home networks typically use copper wires or Wi-Fi, while larger networks use fiber-optic cables for long-distance reliability.
